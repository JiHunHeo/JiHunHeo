### Hi there 👋

👋 Nice to meet you. My name is JiHunHeo. I'm a very funny man! And I am also the father of two wonderful sons living in Ulsan, Korea!👨‍👩‍👦‍👦

🔭 I’m currently working as an instructor at SBS Academy.🏢

👀 I am interested in WebPublishing and FrontEnd! And it is my dream to become a full-stack developer someday!

🌱 I’m currently learning JAVA, Python, Javascript, React.js, Veu, C, C#, C++, and BigData.

👯 I want to collaborate so that I can learn more quickly in what I learn.

🤔 I'm always welcome if you can constantly tell me what's lacking or wrong with me. I'd appreciate it if you could help me a lot.

📫 My G-Mail address is soul070831@gmail.com

⚡ I was actually more interested in music than in programming. In fact, I recently attended a competition in my area and won a silver prize!🥈<br>
   Since then, I've also been active in the choir as an amateur baritone!🎙<br>
   Now I spend more time studying programming than practicing singing!💻
   
💪 Below are the languages I can handle even a little bit. (My tech stack) I'm going to keep adding the things I've been studying!💡
